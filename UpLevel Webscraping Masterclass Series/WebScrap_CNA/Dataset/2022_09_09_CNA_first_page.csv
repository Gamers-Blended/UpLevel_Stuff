Singapore,Jail for man who instigated girlfriend to take intimate photos of her mother and threatened to post nudes,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-instigate-girlfriend-take-nudes-mother-threaten-jail-2926866,1662617220,"SINGAPORE: In a case the defence called ""bizarre and weird"", a man instigated his girlfriend to take private photos of her mother for his sexual gratification. He also threatened to beat his girlfriend or kill himself if she did not come up with other ways to ""satisfy his sexual desires"". The 25-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect the identities of his now former girlfriend and her mother, was sentenced to 20 weeks' jail on Thursday (Sep 8). He pleaded guilty to one count of instigating his ex-girlfriend to commit the offence of voyeurism on her mother, and a second count of threatening to distribute intimate images and recordings of his ex-girlfriend. Another two charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that the offender was in a romantic relationship with the victim, a 23-year-old woman, since 2018. On multiple occasions, the offender recorded videos of himself having sex with the victim. ""These recordings were made with her consent,"" said the prosecutor. About five times a week, the offender demanded that his then-girlfriend send him nudes of herself. If she refused, he would threaten to kill himself, beat her or post the nude photos or videos he already had of her online. As a result of his threats, the woman complied with his requests. In early 2020, the offender told his girlfriend that the intimate images and recordings ""no longer sufficed to satisfy his sexual desires"", the court heard. Fearing that the offender would beat her or post her nudes online, the girlfriend suggested that he imagine himself having sex with her mother instead. The offender agreed, but said it ""would not suffice"" to just imagine and demanded that she take photos of her mother in the nude, court documents stated. The girlfriend then surreptitiously took a photo of her mother's bare chest when she exited the shower at home, and sent the photo to the offender. Later that year, the offender posed as his girlfriend and sent nude photos of her to a stranger on a messaging service. When the girlfriend asked to end the relationship, the offender would refuse and repeated his threats to beat her and post the nudes online. In February last year, the offender told his girlfriend that he ""needed to satisfy his sexual desires"" and demanded that she think of ways to do so. When she replied that she could not, the offender threatened her again. On another occasion, he repeated his demand and told her to contact strangers for sex. This time, he threatened to upload the photo of his girlfriend's mother and use it as his display picture on social media platforms. The victim was afraid and downloaded the mobile application Tinder where she contacted strangers and asked for sex, before sending the conversations to the offender as he demanded. She finally reported the matter to the police on Mar 14, 2021. When the offender learnt of this, he deleted all the messages and intimate footage and photos he had of his girlfriend. Deputy Public Prosecutor Bryont Chin asked for 18 to 21 weeks' jail, citing the severity and frequency of the threats and the fact that the offender was in an intimate relationship with the victim. ""The accused threatened to post the images and recordings on widely used platforms like Instagram and Reddit,"" said Mr Chin. ""When posting, it would have been immortalised on the Internet and further propagated."" He slammed the offender's ""depravity"", saying he committed the offences ""for his own perverted sexual gratification"". Defence lawyer S S Dhillon said his client pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. ""From the outset, (I) highlight that this is a bizarre and weird relationship between the first victim and the accused,"" he said. ""On multiple occasions when they engaged in sex, the accused recorded videos showing the victim having sex with him. The recordings were made with her consent. Such is the extent of their relationship. It's not a one-sided affair, but both parties were doing this with consent,"" he said. He said that it was the victim who suggested the offender imagine having sex with her mother. District Judge Paul Chan interjected and said he did not consider this mitigatory. ""If you consider the circumstances in which the first victim made this suggestion - she did so because she feared the accused would beat her or post her images. It's not mitigatory that it was the first victim who made this suggestion - she was coerced into making this suggestion,"" he said. Mr Dhillon repeated that this was ""a bizarre and weird relationship"" and said it was also the victim's suggestion for her to have sex with strangers. He said his client was not ""a mastermind of the whole enterprise"". He said his client is a first-time offender and has a medical record for anxiety attacks and depression, but was unable to obtain the Institute of Mental Health report as he cannot afford it. Mr Dhillon said his client has since broken off the relationship with the victim and has ""never disturbed her"". ""He realises that he is wrong. He is remorseful and has never reoffended all this time,"" he said. Judge Chan told the offender that his offences ""are depraved and have no place in our society"". ""I note that while the accused did not perform the act of taking the photographs himself, his culpability was quite high indeed,"" said the judge. He added that the offence occurred in a context where the offender very frequently threatened to kill himself, beat the victim or post her nudes online. Hence, the girlfriend was ""compelled to think of an alternative"", he said. ""The first victim merely suggested that the accused imagine himself having sex with the second victim. The accused took this further and demanded that the first victim take photos of the second victim,"" said Judge Chan. ""He knew she could do this as the second victim would not have her guard up against the first victim, who was her own daughter."" He disagreed with the defence's argument that the offender was not the mastermind."
Singapore,"Safe-distancing ambassador stole Lego sets while deployed at mall, gets jail",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/safe-distancing-ambassador-steal-lego-vivo-city-jail-2926651,1662607107,"SINGAPORE: A man who was deployed to a mall as a safe-distancing ambassador during the COVID-19 pandemic stole from shops instead, selling Lego sets he filched from Toys ""R"" Us. The court heard that he was a serial thief with convictions dating back to 2007. Muhammad Israfael Abdullah was given 20 weeks' jail on Thursday (Sep 8). The 34-year-old pleaded guilty to two counts of theft, with two other charges taken into consideration. The court heard that Israfael was deployed to VivoCity in HarbourFront as a safe-distancing ambassador. While on duty on Jun 13 this year, he went to Toys ""R"" Us three times and stole three Lego sets worth about S$540 by placing them in a tote bag. He immediately put up advertisements online and sold the Lego sets to an unknown buyer at the vehicle drop-off point at VivoCity that same day. He received S$100 for the sale and went back to the mall to steal a backrest worth about S$110 from the Self-Fix store. Israfael's acts were captured on closed-circuit television cameras. A manager of Toys ""R"" Us lodged an electronic police report that afternoon and Israfael was arrested. The S$100 cash was seized from him, as well as the backrest. The Lego sets have not been recovered and no restitution has been made, said the prosecutor. Israfael's charges taken into consideration show that he had stolen from the shops at VivoCity on other occasions: He took Lego sets and a pocket fishing game worth about S$168 in total on Jun 4 this year, and five Lego sets worth about S$390 on Jun 11 this year. The prosecutor asked for 20 weeks' jail. He listed Israfael's previous convictions: He was sentenced to probation in 2007 for theft, and breached his probation a month later. For his breach, he was fined but instead served four days' jail in default. In 2009, he was convicted of theft and having unlawful carnal connection with a minor, for which he received seven weeks' jail. In 2017, he was jailed two weeks for theft. In 2019, he was given four weeks' jail for theft. His latest conviction was in August last year, when he received six weeks' jail for theft. The prosecutor said the theft in the present case was premeditated and that Israfael was deployed to perform his duties as a safe-distancing ambassador but instead stole from the shops. ""Immediately after stealing the Lego sets, the accused sold them for profit,"" said the prosecutor. The judge told Israfael that he read his mitigation plea and will not be considering a community-based sentence given that he has ""so many past offences"". Asked if he had anything else to say, Israfael said: ""Whatever it is, I am prepared to take the 20 weeks."" The judge told him: ""I hope at some point you will stop stealing. If you continue to do so, you can expect heavier sentences."" He allowed Israfael to defer his jail term to October to settle some matters, and asked Israfael to stay in court for a while after his case to speak to a court counsellor. For theft, he could have been jailed up to seven years and fined."
World,Suspect in Canada stabbing spree dies soon after arrest ,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/canada-mass-stabbing-saskatchewan-suspect-arrested-myles-sanderson-manhunt-2926431,1662592920,"SASKATOON, Saskatchewan: The suspect sought by Canadian authorities in a weekend stabbing spree that killed 10 people in and around an indigenous reserve was arrested on Wednesday (Sep 7), but suffered unspecified ""medical distress"" and died a short time later at a hospital, police said. Official word that the four-day manhunt for Myles Sanderson, 30, ended with his death came during a late-night news conference hours after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reported he had been taken into custody. The RCMP said the arrest took place near the town of Rosthern, Saskatchewan, about 100km southwest of the area where one of the bloodiest acts of mass violence in the country's history unfolded on Sunday. Canada's Global News agency, citing multiple law enforcement sources, later reported that Sanderson had surrendered to police and was taken away alive in an ambulance after a highway pursuit in which police rammed his vehicle off the road. Global News said he died shortly afterward of unspecified injuries that authorities believe were self-inflicted."
Asia,Malaysian businessman escapes house arrest: What we know so far about the 'Fat Leonard’ scandal,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysian-leornard-francis-escape-ankle-bracelet-san-diego-2925131,1662544507,"WASHINGTON: United States law enforcement agencies are on the lookout for Malaysian businessman Leonard Glenn Francis, who is reportedly on the run after he escaped house arrest in San Diego, California last Sunday (Sep 4). Francis, who is widely known as “Fat Leonard”, was due to be sentenced in three weeks, after he pleaded guilty in a corruption case involving the US Navy. He was found missing from his San Diego residence when police were sent to check on him after discovering that there was a problem with his electronic ankle bracelet. The Malaysian national ran a military contracting company out of Singapore. He was accused of giving bribes to Navy officers to influence them to steer official work toward his shipyards, which American prosecutors said had been overcharging the Navy. US media reported that Francis was arrested in 2013 following a federal sting operation in a San Diego hotel, after he was suspected of running a vast corruption scheme which involved some naval officers treated to food, drink and paid sex. He was said to have used his influence with senior commanders to secure lucrative military contracts often involving the Indo-Pacific based 7th Fleet - the largest of the Navy's forward deployed fleets. He pleaded guilty in 2015 to offering about US$500,000 in bribes to Navy officers. In return, the officers made sure that US naval vessels, including aircraft carriers, were diverted towards Francis’ Singapore-based company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia, for servicing. In the process, the Navy was overcharged by an estimated US$35 million. This was later dubbed the “Fat Leonard” scandal by the US media. According to The Washington Post, the scandal was perhaps the worst national-security breach of its kind to hit the US Navy since the end of the Cold War."

Edo Kurniawan was vice president of controlling and finance at the firm - a Singapore subsidiary of German payment and financial services provider Wirecard AG - when he allegedly conspired with three former colleagues and Henry Yeo Chiew Hai to misappropriate funds from Wirecard Asia among other offences. The three former employees are James Aga Wardhana, Chai Ai Lim and See Lee Wee. All three and Yeo, a director of Singapore firm Jacobson Fareast Marketing Services, were charged in court on Aug 17. A warrant of arrest was issued against Edo then, and on Wednesday (Sep 7) the Singapore Police Force added in a press release that an Interpol red notice was also issued against him on Aug 22. Interpol red notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. It is a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person - pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action. Red notices are published by Interpol at the request of member countries, of which Singapore is one."
Singapore,Phoon Chiu Yoke seeks court's green light to leave Singapore after being charged again for not wearing mask,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/phoon-chiu-yoke-badge-lady-leave-singapore-charge-not-wearing-mask-china-2924911,1662537180,"SINGAPORE: Hours after being charged with new offences of failing to wear a mask, a woman returned to court to seek the green light to leave the country. Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, said she had already planned to go to China via Hong Kong before she was informed about the latest charges. Phoon received two charges on Wednesday (Sep 7) morning for failing to wear a mask on Orchard Road a few weeks before outdoor mask rules were relaxed. She was also given a third charge of failing to turn up for an investigation by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) for failing to wear a mask. On Wednesday afternoon, Phoon returned to court for an application to leave jurisdiction. The police prosecutor opened by saying that STB had updated that Phoon faces a fourth pending charge that has yet to be tendered. On the application to leave Singapore, the prosecutor has asked for the case to be fixed on Monday for them to consider it as they do not yet have the details. The judge told Phoon that the documents she had tendered for her application to leave the country were incomplete. Phoon intends to leave Singapore for China via Hong Kong on Sep 13. However, the judge said she provided only her itinerary for travel within China and not one for Hong Kong nor any ticket from Singapore to Hong Kong or China. Phoon explained that she intended to travel by land from Hong Kong to Shenzhen. The judge said she did not have any tickets for her travel from Singapore to Hong Kong, and questioned Phoon on whether she would be able to travel to China without relevant approvals. Phoon said she had checked with the authorities and claimed that she can enter China for 14 days without a visa nor quarantine. ""Are you able to show me all the relevant documentation that you are able to travel to China without 14 days' quarantine?"" asked the judge. ""I can enter for 14 days and return on the 15th day without a visa,"" Phoon answered. ""Even if you are a tourist? Because I understand they have a closed-door policy,"" said the judge. ""When I bought the tickets, I checked both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website as well as the airline website requirements,"" answered Phoon. She explained that she received the summons to court only on Sep 2, but had made her travel plans two weeks ago. Travellers to China must undergo a seven-day centralised quarantine, followed by three days of home monitoring for most cities, said the country's National Health Commission on Jun 27. Singaporeans are advised to check with the local authorities on the quarantine and other policies that they must adhere to, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on its website. The judge asked Phoon to submit the remaining required documentation and adjourned the case to Monday, when the request will be considered."
Singapore,"Woman jailed for breaching COVID-19 quarantine to shop, collect 4D winnings and get vaccinated",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-jailed-breach-covid-19-quarantine-collect-4d-winnings-2924671,1662526680,"SINGAPORE: Despite knowing that she was quarantined as she was a close contact of a COVID-19 case, a woman repeatedly breached quarantine by going out to window shop, collect lottery winnings and get vaccinated. Ang Siew Wah, 60, repeatedly shouted at Certis Cisco call agents and demanded to know who would support her and that she needed to eat. Ang was jailed for nine weeks on Wednesday (Sep 7). She pleaded guilty to one count under the Infectious Diseases Act of exposing others to the risk of infection, with another four charges taken into consideration. The court heard that a Certis Cisco call agent got in touch with Ang on behalf of the Ministry of Health (MOH) on the morning of Jul 23 last year to speak to her about her quarantine order. In the call, Ang confirmed that she had received a notification from MOH the day before that she was under quarantine from Jul 22 to Jul 29, 2021, as she was a contact of a COVID-19 patient. Ang asked the agent about an upcoming COVID-19 vaccination appointment. Ang was told she had to reschedule it as she was not allowed to go out. Ang retorted: ""Then don't need to buy medicine lah, don't need to eat lah, that means cannot go out cannot eat lah."" The agent told Ang that she had to stay in a hotel for her quarantine, but Ang shouted at her: ""You are kidding me, I don't like to stay hotel, I want to stay at home."" Two agents called Ang multiple times because they either could not hear her properly or because Ang claimed she was working and had ""no time"" for them. When told she could not work as she was under quarantine, Ang said: ""I need money to eat. Who wants to support me?"" She repeated such remarks over multiple calls, and the agent eventually told Ang that if she wanted to quarantine herself at home instead of in a hotel, then her husband would also not be allowed to leave the house. Ang shouted: ""Hello! You are nonsense ah. If my husband cannot go out, how do we eat? Call MOH, call government to talk to me ok?"" A different agent called Ang that same morning and repeated the information to her, to which Ang replied in a similar fashion. She then claimed that she was working, and when the agent told her she had to inform her employer that she was under quarantine, Ang repeated her argument about needing to ""survive"". After the phone calls, Ang went out for about seven-and-a-half hours on the same day. From about 10.20am to about 5.45pm on Jul 23, 2021, she went to Kovan MRT station and Heartland Mall to eat, window shop and collect her 4D winnings. Court documents did not indicate how much these were. She returned by bus in the evening and was not working as she had claimed. She continued to head out over the next few days despite knowing she was under quarantine. On Jul 24, 2021, she took a bus to Ang Mo Kio on separate occasions to buy lunch and dinner. The following day, she again travelled by bus, this time to Teck Ghee Community Centre for her COVID-19 vaccination, even though she had been told not to do so. She also made bus trips to buy food on Jul 28 and Jul 29, 2021, and did not return to her workplace throughout her quarantine period. The prosecution asked for nine to 10 weeks' jail for Ang, calling her a ""recalcitrant offender who clearly did not intend to comply with the quarantine order"". She shouted at the call agents and lied to them that she was at work, said the prosecutor. ""In fact, she was out for frivolous purposes, to window shop and to collect 4D winnings,"" she added. The prosecutor said it was ""purely fortuitous"" that Ang tested negative for COVID-19 on Jul 28, 2021. Ang has a previous conviction in 2005 for theft, for which she served 10 weeks in jail. In mitigation, she told the judge via a Mandarin interpreter that she did not know the law. ""I'm pleading for leniency. Please give me a lighter sentence,"" she said. In response, the prosecutor said that ignorance of the law is not a defence, adding that Ang had repeatedly acknowledged during the phone calls that she knew she was under quarantine. The judge said Ang had no intention of complying with the order from the outset. After being informed that she had to stay at home, she promptly left home and continued to do so on four of the remaining six days of her quarantine period, said the judge. ""Such wilful non-compliance with measures to contain the spread of the virus warrant a sufficiently stiff sentence that will deter others from ... such conduct that affects public health and safety,"" she said."
Singapore,"Phoon Chiu Yoke, jailed last year for breaking COVID-19 laws, gets new charges for not wearing a mask",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/phoon-chiu-yoke-badge-lady-new-charges-not-wearing-mask-court-2924386,1662515280,"SINGAPORE: A woman who was jailed last year for breaking multiple COVID-19 regulations was brought back to court on Wednesday (Sep 7) for fresh charges of failing to wear a mask when required. Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, received three new charges on Wednesday. Two are for breaching COVID-19 regulations by failing to wear a mask when it was required and one charge is under the Infectious Diseases Act for not complying with an officer during investigations. She is accused of failing to wear a mask over her nose and mouth along Mandarin Gallery in Orchard Road at about 3pm on Mar 6. A second similar charge states that she did not wear a mask outside Victoria's Secret in Orchard Road about half an hour later that same day. Phoon is also charged with failing to attend an investigation for not wearing a mask. She was supposed to be at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Mar 31 this year. STB said in March this year that investigations were ongoing after influencer Xiaxue, or Wendy Cheng, posted an Instagram Story in March of Phoon walking along Orchard Road without a mask on. On Wednesday, Phoon turned up unrepresented. The prosecution said that they are ready with the case and intend to proceed on a mask charge and the charge of failing to attend the investigation, with the other mask charge taken into consideration for sentencing. Phoon asked if he could explain what taken into consideration means and told the judge she would ""probably be self-represented"". She also said she intended to ""plea with mitigation factors"". Phoon will return to court for a pre-trial conference in October. Phoon hit the news last year when a video of her not wearing a mask at Marina Bay Sands went viral. She was filmed removing her mask outside the State Courts and received another charge for this. She was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail in September last year. On Mar 29, wearing a mask outdoors in Singapore was made optional. That was extended to indoor areas - except on public transport and in healthcare facilities - on Aug 29. If convicted of failing to wear a mask when required, Phoon could be jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$20,000 or both as a repeat offender. The penalties are the same for a repeat offence of not complying with an officer during investigations under the Infectious Diseases Act."

Canadian police said on Monday (Sep 5) they found one of the suspects in the mass stabbing spree dead while the other suspect, his brother, remained at large. Police are still trying to determine a motive for Sunday's attacks, mostly in a sparsely populated indigenous community, that shocked a country where mass violence is rare. The incidents took place in the James Smith Cree Nation and village of Weldon in the province of Saskatchewan, police said. Hours before the stabbings, Lana Head, a mother of two daughters, posted on Facebook that she had ""so many good memories to cherish"". Head's friends and family were shocked by her death and paid tributes on social media. ""Not the way I wanted her to leave this world,"" said Melodie Whitecap, Head's childhood friend who had planned to visit her before the stabbing. Head's former partner also spoke to local media and implied the stabbings might have been related to drugs and alcohol. ""It's sick how jail time, drugs and alcohol can destroy many lives,"" Michael Brett Burns, Head's former partner, told the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network. A statement by indigenous leaders also indicated the attacks might have been drug-related. Ivor Burns and Darryl Burns from the James Smith Cree Nation told Reuters their sister, Gloria, was among the dead. They blamed drugs and alcohol as well. ""We have 10 people dead, including my sister. She was butchered ... with her friend and a 14-year-old boy, all three of them,"" Ivor Burns said in an interview."

Malaysian Khoo Ee Seong, 29, was sentenced on Tuesday (Sep 6) to 20 weeks' jail and a fine of S$4,000. He pleaded guilty to four counts of intruding on a woman's privacy with intention to insult her modesty and one charge of possessing obscene films. Another 10 charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that Khoo was at the platform of Paya Lebar MRT Station on the afternoon of Feb 10, 2019, when officers attached to the Transcom Patrol Unit spotted him behaving suspiciously. They approached Khoo and checked his belongings. They found videos of Khoo having sex with an unknown woman in his two phones, and they also found three thumb drives on Khoo. Khoo admitted that there were obscene films stored in the drives, and he was arrested and his devices seized. Forensic examination of Khoo's first phone uncovered five videos of him having sex with different women. He had paid a woman for sex with him at his flat at about 2.45am on Jul 12, 2017. He placed his phone in a corner of the room with the video-recording mode on before the woman arrived and filmed her having sex with him without her knowledge. Another video of Khoo having sex with a woman was found on his other phone. He paid this woman for sex with him at her flat at about 5.30pm on Jan 2, 2019, and again set up his phone to record the encounter without her knowledge. The first of Khoo's thumb drives contained videos of him having sex with two other women in the same manner, while the remaining three thumb drives contained eight obscene films. He had downloaded these films from pornography websites and saved them for personal viewing. One of them was more than 46 minutes long. For intruding on a woman's privacy with intention to insult her modesty, he could have been jailed up to a year and fined per charge. For possessing obscene films, he could have been fined S$500 per film with a cap of S$20,000, jailed up to six months, or both."
Singapore,"Former ITE lecturer jailed for taking upskirt shots on campus, had 133 illicit photos",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/upskirt-ite-lecturer-campus-jail-student-2922646,1662442500,"SINGAPORE: A former lecturer with the Institute of Technical Education was jailed for four months on Tuesday (Sep 6) for taking multiple upskirt photos and videos on campus. The 48-year-old man's victims included students and a female target in the cafeteria of an Institution of Technical Education. A gag order was imposed barring the publication of any information that might identify the victims. The man pleaded guilty to two counts of insulting a woman's modesty and a third charge of attempting to insult a woman's modesty. Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that the offender was working at an Institute of Technical Education at the time of the offences. On Oct 25, 2019, he was teaching a Life Skills class when he spotted a student wearing a tight skirt revealing her legs. He selected her as his target and walked towards her with his phone camera switched on. On the pretext of assisting her with her work, the man placed his phone at the edge of the table before taking several photos using the volume button on his phone. When the class ended, he ensured no one was around and looked at the photos before realising he had failed to capture any images or videos of the student. Meanwhile, the student had spotted the lecturer positioning his phone camera lens towards her skirt. She immediately texted her father, sister and classmates, and her sister reported the matter to the police. His phone was seized and at least 133 upskirt images and 17 videos were extracted from it. Police investigations revealed the offender's modus operandi: He would look out for female students with short skirts around the school. He would also look out for female students who were ""sitting improperly in his lecture class"", court documents said. He would then turn on the camera function on his phone before approaching his target under the guise of teaching her. He would then photograph or record up the student's skirt and review the footage after the lesson was over. By the accused's own estimates, he filmed such upskirt videos and photos over the course of four to five months at a frequency of once a fortnight. He took an upskirt photo and video of an unidentified female victim in the school cafeteria on Jun 5, 2019, and an upskirt video of another victim at the school's general office on Jul 29, 2019. The prosecutor asked for between four and six months' jail, saying that the offender had abused his position of trust and authority as a lecturer. He had a number of upskirt photos and videos, and committed the offences in a covert manner, she said. For each charge of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined."
World,Malaysian contractor at heart of US Navy's biggest corruption scandal flees house arrest,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/fat-leonard-francis-us-navy-worst-corruption-scandal-flees-gps-2922446,1662436095,"WASHINGTON: A military contractor who pleaded guilty in the US Navy's worst corruption scandal has escaped house arrest in San Diego, the US Marshals Service said on Monday (Sep 5). ""Leonard Francis cut off his GPS monitoring ankle bracelet Sunday morning,"" Supervisory Deputy US Marshal Omar Castillo told AFP in a statement. Widely known as ""Fat Leonard"", Francis was due to be sentenced in three weeks, US media said. Francis, a Malaysian national who ran a military contracting company out of Singapore, pleaded guilty in 2015 to offering about US$500,000 in bribes to Navy officers to steer official work to his shipyards, carrying out work on US vessels that prosecutors say he overcharged the Navy for, to the tune of US$35 million. Police were sent to his San Diego residence on Sunday after the agency monitoring his ankle bracelet reported a problem with the device, Castillo said. ""Upon arrival they noticed that nobody was home,"" he said. ""They then notified US Marshals who went to the house and verified that he was no longer there. As of now multiple leads are being investigated."" The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the cut-off GPS bracelet was found in the house, while neighbours said they had seen U-Haul moving trucks coming and going at the property in the days leading up to his escape. Francis was arrested in 2013 and pleaded guilty two years later. He suffered numerous health problems, including kidney cancer, which led to him being released to house arrest in 2018 while acting as a cooperating witness for federal prosecutors. He was due to be sentenced on Sep 22. Four Navy officers have been found guilty in the case so far, while another 29 people, including naval officials, contractors and Francis himself, have pleaded guilty, US media said."
Singapore,Felicia Teo case: Suspect gets new date to plead guilty to lesser offences including depositing her corpse,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/felicia-teo-case-suspect-ahmad-danial-missing-set-plead-guilty-lesser-offences-depositing-corpse-2922481,1662433460,"SINGAPORE: A man linked to the case of Ms Felicia Teo Wei Ling, who was reported missing in 2007 and later presumed dead, is set to plead guilty to lowered charges including depositing her corpse. Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa'ee, 37, was originally charged in December 2020 with the murder of Ms Teo, who was 19 when she went missing. He was earlier accused of murdering her between 1.39am and 7.20am on Jun 30, 2007 at a flat in Block 19, Marine Terrace with suspected accomplice Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is at large. However, in June this year, Ahmad Danial was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder charge and released from remand. He was given six new charges, all of which are in common intention with Mr Ragil, meaning they allegedly committed the offences together. The offences include depositing Ms Teo's corpse at the vicinity of Punggol Track 24 around Jun 30, 2007, misappropriating Ms Teo's handphone, Apple Macbook Pro and camera, as well as failing to report information about Ms Teo's death to the police. The remaining offences are for giving false information to the police, fabricating false evidence by placing Ms Teo's phone in East Coast Park, and fabricating false evidence by making calls to Ms Teo's phone, leaving her voicemails and sending her messages on social media to create the false impression that both men believed Ms Teo was alive although they knew she was dead. Ahmad Danial was set to plead guilty in July but the hearing was adjourned for both sides to resolve issues including the facts, sentencing and documentation. He will next return to court on Oct 14 to enter his guilty plea and is out on bail of S$20,000. Those convicted of depositing a corpse can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$2,000 or both. Anyone who fabricates false evidence can be jailed up to seven years or fined. The punishment for misappropriating the property of a dead person is up to three years' jail and a fine. The penalty for omitting to give information to public servants as required by the law is up to one month's jail and a fine of up to S$500. Anyone who gives false information to a public servant can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$1,000 or both."

Shawn Liew Cheng Long, 36, failed to respond to his lawyers since the last court mention. On Tuesday morning, a warrant of arrest was issued for Liew when he did not show up in court. But he turned up later that morning and explained that he was late. The arrest warrant was then withdrawn. He was told to engage new lawyers by the next court mention and to return to court on Sep 27. Liew was charged in July with one count of conspiring with another man to assist the former managing director of Envy Global Trading Ng Yu Zhi to leave Singapore illegally. This was when Ng was under investigation for criminal offences. Liew is accused of engaging in a conspiracy with Ang Yew Teck around August 2021 to help Ng leave Singapore and obstruct the course of justice. He allegedly offered Ng plans to leave the country. Ang was given a similar charge in February and faces other offences including illegal gambling acts. The police previously said in a statement that this case is separate from another bid by three others to help Ng escape. All three have been sentenced to jail. Ng faces more than 100 charges, including cheating and criminal breach of trust. One of the charges is for dishonestly misappropriating at least S$201.2 million from Envy Global Trading's DBS bank account between August 2020 and February 2021. His alleged victims include a criminal lawyer who was allegedly cheated in an arrangement involving more than S$1 million between October 2020 and January 2021, as well as a woman listed as general counsel on Temasek's website.

Ng is also accused of cheating a former president of the Law Society of Singapore of about S$87,000 between October 2020 and December 2020. Ng is next set to return to court for a pre-trial conference in October."
